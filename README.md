<h1> Constants in C <h1>
<h4> As the name suggests, a constant in C is a variable that cannot be modified once it is declared in the program. We can not make any change in the value of the constant variables after they are defined.<br>
Syntax to Define Constant <br>

<h1>C Variables</h1>
<h4>A variable in C is a memory location with some name that helps store some form of data and retrieves it when required. We can store different types of data in the variable and reuse the same variable for storing some other data any number of times.</h4>

<h1>Type Conversion in C</h1>
<h4>Type conversion in C is the process of converting one data type to another. The type conversion is only performed to those data types where conversion is possible. Type conversion is performed by a compiler. In type conversion, the destination data type can’t be smaller than the source data type. Type conversion is done at compile time and it is also called widening conversion because the destination data type can’t be smaller than the source data type. There are two types of Conversion:<br>
1. Implicit Type Conversion <br>
2. Explicit Type Conversion</h4>
